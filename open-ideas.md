## Ideas
These are some random ideas that I may or may not ever get time to work on. There all CC0 licensed so you may use them as you see fit but I'd be nice to know what your doing with them if they do happen to go anywhere :)

### Random
- CV (curriculum vitae) as a mind map...

### This thing from software development looks cool, how can we use it for science
- Semantically Versioned Scientific Papers

- Figure checklist - things to check before submitting a figure
  - e.g. axis labels legend etc etc

- Back your stack [Support Your Scientific Stack]
  - guide for including software in grant applications
  - why you should include
  - proposal to funders to add this as a recognised section/expense
